# Home - Where I backup all my dotfiles (sort of)
## Dependencies
- FontAwesome (Needed to show the i3bar icons)
- i3-gaps
- rofi
- i3blocks

Remember to edit the ~/.config/i3/config in order to use this config, since it was thought for two screens and there may be some programs that you might want to replace (Like nitrogen for wallpapers)
